# This function is aim to create a list of nn structures (only the hidden layers) with iterations
# The input required 1) a list of potential activation functions, 2) a list of potential number of nodes in each layers, 3) The max number of hidden layers
# First applied this function in automatively generate the stuctures for the DeepSurv/Non-linear model in the PySurvial package
